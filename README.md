# Welcome, Jarvis...
Jarvis is my companion and all-in-one productivity app currently in development.

Jarvis is a complete companion based on engineering management software, GTD, and my own experiences. It has been extremely helpful for me and I hope it can be for you as well!

## Development 
I'm hoping to eventually wrap the underlying Rust in swift for my macbook and iPhone UIs!

Currently I'm working on getting the underlying library running, you can get your hands on Jarvis through the CLI for now or write your own wrapper!
